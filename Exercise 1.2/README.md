# Second Task

## Task Goals:

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Exercise 1.2 Files:

- code practice 1-5 using data structures in different cases
- screenshots of learning journal
- screenshots of creating list of all recipes, creating dictionaries for each recipe, and printing the list of ingredients

## Exercise 2 Task

I choose a dictionary as the recipe data structure because it can store key-value pairs which is exactly what we need in this case. A dictionary also is very flexible and can be modified or changed if one needs to make an update to the recipe.

As an outer structure for the recipe data structure all_recipes I choose a list, because it is very flexible and one can add, remove and reorder recipes.
