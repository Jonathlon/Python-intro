Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 
Learning Goals

●	Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
●	Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? 
    If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

    Answer: The front end is what the client interacts with i.e mobile/web browser or application the backend is the server, business logic and the data. If hired to
            to work on the backend of a web application id be working on the web server, api endpoints, authentication and database.

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use 
    JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities 
    and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would 
    you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
   
   Answer: Both Python and JavaScript are dynamic high-level scripting languages both are executed line by line however python is build to be more readable
           and uses understandable command words which assit in keeping the code error free and easier for others to understand. Python has a large number of open-source 
           packages and interactivce shell which also assit in keeping code error free as commands can be tested in isolation. Both have a large community support, however 
           Python has one of the largest and most co-operative communities. 

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. 
    You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of 
    this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

    Answer: 

    - I want to learn more about what Python can be used for
    - I want to learn more about automation and scripting
    - As I understand Python is the fastest growning language, I want to know how i can 
      develop my skills to make me stand out from others
