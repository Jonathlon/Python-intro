# First Task

## Task Goals:

- Create developer virtual enviroment to avoide package version conflicts
- Creat python file with python program to add two numbers using basic python syntax

## Exercise 1.1 Files:

- add.py file that adds two numbers
- requirments.txt holds dependencies for virtual enviroment
- screenshots of creating new virtual enviroment and installing ipython to enviroment

# Second Task

## Task Goals:

- Explain variables and data types in Python
- Summarize the use of objects in Python
- Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Exercise 1.2 Files:

- code practice 1-5 using data structures in different cases
- screenshots of learning journal
- screenshots of creating list of all recipes, creating dictionaries for each recipe, and printing the list of ingredients

## Exercise 2 Task

I choose a dictionary as the recipe data structure because it can store key-value pairs which is exactly what we need in this case. A dictionary also is very flexible and can be modified or changed if one needs to make an update to the recipe.

As an outer structure for the recipe data structure all_recipes I choose a list, because it is very flexible and one can add, remove and reorder recipes.

## Third Task

### Task Goals:

- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
- Write functions to organize Python code

### Exercise 1.3 Files:

- code practice 1-3 using loops and functions
- screenshots of learning journal
- create a script that allows you create a recipe by adding the name,cooking time, ingredients, and difficuly.
  then storing the recipe and ingredients in an array.
- name_capitalizer.py is a file of practice task through the exercise that i followed along with.

## Fourth Task

### Task Goals:

- use files to store and retrieve data.

### Exercise 1.4 Files:

- recipe_input.py having the users input data for a recipe. once data has been inputted, it is pickled and stored into a file named by the user.
- recipe_search.py allows the user to access the pickled file, and select ingredients by number. then the selected ingredient will find all of the recipes with the selected ingredient.
- harrys.bin and Taho.bin are pickled files that can be accessed throught recipe_search.py and updated throught recipe_input.py
- step 1.png, step 1 result.png, and step 2.png shows the results of recipe_input.py and recipe_search.py scripts being ran (with examples recipes from Taho.bin file).
